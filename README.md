# MscDataAnalytics_CA2
A data science project into air traffic in Ireland

## Assessment Brief
Students are advised to review and adhere to the submission requirements documented after the assessment task. Scenario

## Transport in Ireland
“Smartcard ticketing systems currently available in many cities’ public transport systems enable a vast amount of data. These datasets reflect how people behave, which in turn means it is possible to assess their transport needs and provide an accurate picture of their habits, either as groups (based on fare types, such as student, elderly and so on) or at an individual level. Thanks to big data analytics, we can adapt public transport to these needs, plan new services, minimise walking time and so on.”— https://www.engineersireland.ie/Brexit/big-data-enables-better-urban-transport-networks

You have been tasked with analysing Ireland's Transport data and comparing the Irish Transport sector with other countries (of your choosing) worldwide. This analysis should also include forecasting, sentiment analysis and evidence-based recommendations for the sector as well as a complete rationale of the entire process used to discover your findings. Your Research could include vehicle traffic, type of vehicles used, freight transport, air traffic, transport infrastructure etc. (or any other relevant topic EXCEPT Climate change) with Ireland as your base line. Note: ● While topical, Construction impact on Climate Change SHOULD NOT be chosen as an area of research for this assessment.

You must source appropriate data sets from any available repository (eg. But not restricted to https://data.gov.ie/organization/transport-infrastructure-ireland) to inform your research (all datasets MUST be referenced and the relevant licence/permissions detailed).
